# Reading List with Google Books

A small CLI app that lets you query Google Books API.

* A query displays a list of 5 books (author, title, publishing company)
* You can select a book from the list to save to a "Reading List"
* You can view the "Reading List" with all books saved

# Run the program

From the terminal using `python -m readinglist` or from an IDE, run `__main__.py`.
